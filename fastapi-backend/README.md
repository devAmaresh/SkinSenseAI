### Step 1: Project Structure

Create the following directory structure for your FastAPI project:

```
fastapi-skin-checker/
│
├── app/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── core/
│   │   └── config.py
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── product.py
│   └── routers/
│       └── product.py
└── .env
```

### Step 2: Create the Configuration

You already have the `config.py` file set up. Ensure it is in the `app/core/` directory.

### Step 3: Create the Product Model

Create a file named `product.py` in the `app/models/` directory:

```python
# app/models/product.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Product(BaseModel):
    name: str
    ingredients: str
```

### Step 4: Create the Product Router

Create a file named `product.py` in the `app/routers/` directory:

```python
# app/routers/product.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, UploadFile, File, Form
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from app.models.product import Product

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/upload-product/")
async def upload_product(
    file: UploadFile = File(...),
    name: str = Form(...),
    ingredients: str = Form(...)
):
    # Here you can save the file if needed
    # with open(f"uploads/{file.filename}", "wb") as f:
    #     f.write(await file.read())

    # Simple logic to check if the product is beneficial
    beneficial_ingredients = ["aloe vera", "hyaluronic acid", "vitamin C"]
    is_beneficial = any(ingredient.lower() in ingredients.lower() for ingredient in beneficial_ingredients)

    return JSONResponse(content={
        "product_name": name,
        "is_beneficial": is_beneficial,
        "message": "Product uploaded successfully."
    })
```

### Step 5: Create the Main Application File

Create a file named `main.py` in the `app/` directory:

```python
# app/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.routers import product
from app.core.config import settings

app = FastAPI()

app.include_router(product.router)

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the Skin Checker API!"}
```

### Step 6: Create the `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory. You can leave it empty for now or add any necessary environment variables.

### Step 7: Run the Application

Make sure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

Now, you can run your FastAPI application:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Step 8: Test the API

You can test the API using tools like Postman or cURL. Here’s an example of how to use cURL to upload a product:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload-product/" \
-F "file=@path_to_your_file" \
-F "name=Sample Product" \
-F "ingredients=aloe vera, water, glycerin"
```

### Conclusion

This basic FastAPI application allows users to upload a product and check if it contains beneficial ingredients for the skin. You can expand this application by adding more features, such as a database to store products, user authentication, and more sophisticated logic for determining product benefits.
